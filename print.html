<p>Building a Team: The Importance of Ownership and Accountability</p>
<p>Building a team is much like building anything else: you need a solid foundation. You'll find countless articles proposing dozens of "foundational" principles, values, strategies, visions, missions, and more. But it’s actually a lot simpler than that. A high-functioning team and a strong business culture are built on two essential building blocks: ownership and accountability.</p>
<p>The Essence of Ownership</p>
<p>In one of my past teams, I told them, "We share everything from pens to responsibility." That statement embodies the essence of ownership. Team members must feel a sense of responsibility for the team’s output. We are all responsible for client satisfaction, product quality, and achieving the company’s objectives. When everyone takes ownership of the results as a group, we align ourselves towards the same goal.</p>
<p>Ownership isn’t just about individual contributions; it’s about feeling invested in the success of the entire team. When team members see themselves as stakeholders in the organization’s mission, they’re more proactive, innovative, and collaborative. They’re not just showing up to complete tasks—they’re building something they’re proud of.</p>
<p>The Role of Accountability</p>
<p>Accountability is the flipside of ownership. If I feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for the organization and control over my own domain, then I must also own both my successes and my failures.</p>
<p>Accountability comes in two forms:</p>
<p>External Accountability: When a team leader holds team members accountable for their actions.</p>
<p>Internal Accountability: When team members take responsibility for their own mistakes and address them openly.</p>
<p>While both forms are important, the second one—when team members voluntarily fess up to their mistakes—proves the strength of the team. It demonstrates trust, transparency, and a shared commitment to improvement. Accountability fosters a culture where learning from failures is encouraged, and collaboration flourishes.</p>
<p>How Ownership and Accountability Transform Teams</p>
<p>When ownership and accountability are embedded into a team’s culture, they naturally lead to other positive outcomes:</p>
<p>Reduces Micromanagement: When team members take ownership of their work, leaders can focus on strategy and big-picture thinking rather than policing every detail. Accountability ensures tasks are completed without the need for constant oversight.</p>
<p>Increases Commitment and Tenure: Employees who feel a sense of ownership are more committed to the organization’s success. They’re less likely to leave because they see themselves as integral to the team’s achievements.</p>
<p>Creates a Positive Culture: Ownership and accountability promote trust and mutual respect. Team members feel empowered to share ideas, admit mistakes, and support one another.</p>
<p>The Opportunity for Principled Deviation</p>
<p>One of the most interesting benefits of a team grounded in ownership and accountability is that it creates space for what I call principled deviation: breaking the rules for the right reasons. When team members feel trusted and empowered, they’re more likely to challenge processes or make bold decisions in situations where following the rules would hinder the team or the company.</p>
<p>Principled deviation requires a high level of trust within the team. Leaders must trust that their team members are acting in good faith, while team members must trust that leaders will evaluate their decisions fairly. It’s a sign of a truly high-functioning team when individuals feel empowered to act in the organization’s best interest, even if it means bending the rules occasionally.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>If you build a team rooted in ownership and accountability, everything else will fall into place. These two qualities create a foundation for trust, autonomy, and shared success. They reduce the need for micromanagement, foster commitment and loyalty, and establish a culture where people feel safe to innovate, admit mistakes, and grow together.</p>
<p>In my experience, the absence of ownership and accountability has always been the root cause of failure. I’ve never fired someone for a lack of skills alone—only for failing in one of these two areas.</p>
<p>As you think about your own team, ask yourself: Are we fostering ownership and accountability? If the answer is yes, you’re not just building a team—you’re building something that lasts.</p>
